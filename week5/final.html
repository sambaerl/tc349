<p>My final project will be a personal website. My layout is rather straight forward.  I will have a main header along the top of the page as well as two side navigations. The right one will have an image, most likely my face, and a quote tab. The left navigation is the bulk of the website, which includes all of my information. Upon getting feedback, it was decided that there should be a welcome message, just a bit about the website before the viewer went any further. It was also the other participants idea to add two navigations bars, their reasoning being the site would not be so heavy on the left side. I agreed and made the change.</p>
