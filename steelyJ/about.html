<h4>Meet Your Captain</h4>
<article>
<p>Captain Brett Johnson has been fishing the tributaries of the Great Lakes his entire life. 
A Michigander through and through, Captain Brett was raised in Traverse City, fishing the West
and East Bays with a main focus on the Boardman river. Through this, he gained the knowledge and
experience needed for the numerous runs of Salmon and Steelhead throughout the season. Captain Brett
is a United States Marine Corps active duty Gunnery Sergeant who retired in 2008. He started fishing
the St. Joseph River in 1994 while stationed in Southwest Michigan. </p>

<article class="quote"> "The St. Joseph River system is nothing short of spectacular. The beautiful colors 
of the fall and the snow white covered banks in the winter with a river loaded with fish. 
Join me for a day on the River"</article>
